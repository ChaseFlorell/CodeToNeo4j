# Lessons Learned

## Multi-edit Tool usage
- When using `multi_edit`, be extremely careful not to accidentally delete methods or logic that were not intended to be changed. Always verify the resulting file structure.
- In this refactoring, I accidentally removed `GetChangedFiles` during a large replacement. I had to restore it in a subsequent step.

## SRP in SolutionProcessor
- Large orchestration classes like `SolutionProcessor` tend to accumulate responsibilities (File discovery, Git diffing, Dependency extraction, DB initialization).
- Extracting these into services (e.g., `ISolutionFileDiscoveryService`, `IDependencyIngestor`) makes the main orchestration logic much clearer.
- Using `TextDocument` instead of `Document` allows for better interoperability between regular documents and additional documents in Roslyn.

## Roslyn Interoperability
- When handling different file types in a Roslyn solution, prefer `TextDocument` over `Document` in interfaces that need to handle `AdditionalDocument`, `AnalyzerConfigDocument`, or just regular files from disk.
- If syntax tree operations are required (e.g., in `CSharpHandler`), cast the `TextDocument` to `Document` locally. This prevents non-C# documents (which are still `TextDocument`s) from being nulled out by an `as Document` cast at a higher level of abstraction.

## Async Performance and Thread Marshalling
- In performance-critical loops (like processing thousands of files), leverage `Task.WhenAll` to process work in parallel when steps are independent.
- Use chunked parallelism (e.g., chunks of `batchSize`) to avoid overwhelming resources (DB connections, memory) while still gaining performance from concurrency.
- When parallelizing, ensure shared resources are either thread-safe or refactored to be local to the parallel task (e.g., returning results instead of populating a shared buffer).
- For library or non-UI code, always use `ConfigureAwait(false)` on all awaits to prevent unnecessary thread marshalling back to the original synchronization context, which improves performance and avoids potential deadlocks.
